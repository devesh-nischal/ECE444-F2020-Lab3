Activity 3:  
There are many differences between a SQL and noSQL database.  
SQL databases are considered Relational Databases while noSQL databases are non-relational or distributed databases.  
SQL databases require you to define a schema to determine the structure of the data before running queries on it. This makes it good for complex queries, however, it restricts the user since it is constrained by a schema. noSQL databases, however, have dynamic schemas and therefore can hold unstructured data. No pre-determined schema is needed to use a noSQL database. Databases of the noSQL type are not very well suited for complex queries, but provide much more felxibility than SQL databases.
